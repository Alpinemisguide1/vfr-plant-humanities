### Introduction
One Ojibwe legend tells of a lone chickadee who sought shelter under a Tamarack tree (Larix laricina) in winter. During a fierce storm, the chickadee was cold, trapped, and alone. Chickadee asked the Tamarack tree to lower its branches for warmth, but the tree refused. For this, the Great Spirit, Wenabozho, punished the Tamarack.
